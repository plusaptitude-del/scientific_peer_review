# Blockchain for Scientific Peer Review Auditing

## 📖 Project Description
This project implements a decentralized system to ensure transparency, authenticity, and traceability in the **scientific peer review process**. It allows reviewers to submit, store, and verify reviews of scientific papers on the blockchain. The immutability of blockchain ensures that reviews cannot be altered or manipulated after submission, promoting academic integrity.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a **transparent and tamper-proof peer review auditing system** that enhances trust in scientific publishing by recording reviews and ratings securely on a blockchain network.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Decentralized Review Storage** – Each review is stored on-chain with paper hash and metadata.
- **Immutable Records** – Once submitted, data cannot be modified by anyone except the original reviewer.
- **Transparent Auditing** – Researchers, publishers, and institutions can verify the authenticity of peer reviews.
- **Smart Contract–Driven Governance** – No centralized authority needed for validation.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **IPFS** for decentralized paper storage.
- Implementation of **reviewer reputation scores**.
- Support for **multi-level access control** (authors, editors, reviewers).
- Cross-platform dashboard for review analytics and performance metrics.
- Option for **anonymous or blind reviews**.
